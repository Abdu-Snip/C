/*
A person invests $1000.0 in a savings account yielding 5% interest. Assuming that
all interest is left on deposit in the account, calculate and print the amount of money in he
account at the end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula for determining these
amounts:a = p(1+r)^n
p is the original investment(i.e. the principal)
r is the annual interest rate
n is the number of years
a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.
